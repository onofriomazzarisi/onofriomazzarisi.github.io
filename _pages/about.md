I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) and at the [Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale](https://www.ogs.it/it) in Trieste, Italy.
I am a theoretical physicist interested in quantitative biology, community ecology and evolutionary theory and their interface with statistical mechanics.

The core aim of my research is to understand how individual and population processes cascade
up to emergent processes such as ecosystem structure and stability, and macroecological patterns
across ecosystems. Throughout, I use a close combination of extensive theory and field and
experimental data.
