Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas](https://eeb.ku.edu/)
in [Reuman Lab](https://reumanlab.ku.edu/).

My background is in theoretical physics and my PhD focused on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.
While maintaining an interest in the fundamentals and methods of statistical physics, 
the focus of my research mostly shifted to its interface with ecology and evolution during my postdoc
at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Science, Leipzig](https://www.mis.mpg.de/).

Current topics I am working on include links between population dynamics
and macro-ecological patterns and statistical analysis of time series.
