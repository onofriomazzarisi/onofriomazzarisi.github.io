I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) and at the [Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale](https://www.ogs.it/it) in Trieste, Italy.
I am a theoretical physicist interested in quantitative biology, community ecology and evolutionary theory and their interface with statistical mechanics.
