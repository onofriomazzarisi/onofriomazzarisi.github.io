Welcome to my ! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the
[Structure of Evolution group](https://www.smerlak.group/) 
at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Science, Leipzig](https://www.mis.mpg.de/).

My background is in theoretical physics and my PhD focused on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.
While maintaining an interest in the fundamentals and methods of statistical physics, 
the focus of my research has mostly moved to its interface with ecology and evolution.
