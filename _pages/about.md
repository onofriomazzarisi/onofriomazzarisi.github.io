I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) and at the [Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale](https://www.ogs.it/it) in Trieste, Italy.
I am a theoretical physicist interested in quantitative biology, ecology and evolutionary theory.

Topics I am currently excited to work on include 
- Links between ecological community dynamics and macro-ecological patterns.
- The physiological causes and ecological consequences of self-regulation in microbial communities.
- Biodiversity patterns in marine plankton.
