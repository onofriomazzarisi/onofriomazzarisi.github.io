Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Science, Leipzig](https://www.mis.mpg.de/)
in the [Structure of Evolution group](https://www.smerlak.group/).

My background is in theoretical physics and my PhD focused on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.
While maintaining an interest in the fundamentals and methods of statistical physics, 
the focus of my research has mostly shifted to its interface with ecology and evolution.

Current topics I am working on include links between ecological dynamics
and statistical macro-ecological laws and multiplicative stochastic processes in relation to the evolution of cooperation
(In collaboration with [Jacopo Grilli's group at ICTP](https://jacopogrilli.github.io/)).
