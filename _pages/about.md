<sup><sub>Castle Rock Badlands, Kansas, USA</sub></sup>

Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas](https://biosurvey.ku.edu/people/onofrio-mazzarisi)
in [Reuman Lab](https://reumanlab.ku.edu/).

My background is in theoretical physics and my PhD focused on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.
While I keep an active interest in the fundamentals and methods of statistical physics, 
the focus of my research mostly shifted to its interface with ecology and evolution during my postdoc
at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Science, Leipzig](https://www.mis.mpg.de/).

Current topics I am working on include population dynamics and how it is linked to macro-ecological patterns,
the evolutionary stability of cooperative strategies and the analysis of stochastic time series.
