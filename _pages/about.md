Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) (in [Jacopo Grilli](https://jacopogrilli.github.io/) group) and at the [Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale](https://www.ogs.it/it) in the framework of the [Trieste Laboratory on Quantitative Sustainability](https://fondazioneinternazionale.org/tlqs-en/) project.

Themes I am currently working on include links between community dynamics and macro-ecological patterns, microbial ecology and physiology and analysis of stochastic time series.

My background is in theoretical physics, and my PhD focused on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.
The focus of my research mostly shifted to its interface with ecology and evolution during my postdocs
at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Science, Leipzig](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) and the [Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas](https://biosurvey.ku.edu/people/onofrio-mazzarisi)
in [Reuman Lab](https://reumanlab.ku.edu/).
